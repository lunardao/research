## Obtaining Monero

- Local Monero - [https://localmonero.co/](https://localmonero.co/)
- Mining

## Spending Best Practices

- Advanced attacks: Poisoned Outputs Attacks (EAE Attacks)- Avoid posting addresses online or re-using addresses. Use a new subaddress for every transaction. Avoid malicious entites on both sides of your transactions. Reduce the interations with malicious parties that could surveil your transactions. 

- Janus attack mitigations - If trying to completely maintain 100% subaddress unlinkability, use different wallet seeds. This is a tradeoff of convenience for privacy.

## Metadata Considerations | Potential Attack Vectors

- Timing analysis - run a full node. Keep it running 24/7, you can run an open node that other people can route transactions through, which you can hide among these other people routing through this node.
- counterparty surveillance
- churning (?)
- Remote node considerations

Many attackers are observing information on-chain but also grabs off-chain data

Block explorer - transaction and IP address linking - if using a block explorer, use a hidden service over TOR or I2P. When using a block explorer, 

- Use TOR, VPN, I2p. Use different browser sessions.

- **Best solution:** run your own node and you can query the information locally.
