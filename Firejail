## What is Firejail
https://firejail.wordpress.com/

Firejail allows a process and all its descendants to have their own private view of the globally shared kernel resources. There are no dependencies for firejail and can run on any linux computer running kernel 3.8 or higher. Firejail creates a security sandbox around any type of process. This sandbox restricts the process' running environment to a linux namespace. There are very little configurations to edit.

## Downloading Firejail
Arch Linux:
> pacman -S firejail
Debian:
 > sudo apt install firejail
Fedora:
> dnf install firejail
openSUSE:
> zypper install firejail

If you want to create separate profiles for all of your applications on your device, run the fire config command with sudo privileges and it will generate profiles for applications on your device.

> sudo firecfg

- This creates symlinks to usr/local/bin/. This allows the programs to run by default sandboxed.
- Creates new desktop files removing hardcoded paths to ensure the desktop files will run in a sandbox
- Adds the running user to the allowed users list


## Librewolf and Firejail

You can download librewolf from here  https://librewolf.net/

To view the benefits of librewolf visit our privacy tools page https://wiki.lunardao.net/list_privacy_tools.html#browsers

Once both librewolf and firejail are installed you'll need to build a librewolf profile for firejail to use

> firejail --build=firewolf.profile firewolf


After building a librewolf profile, you can run this command with no further configurations

> firejail librewolf


You now have librewolf running in a security sandbox.


## Benefits of Firejail

If you are running a process in a sandbox, you control the environment in which the process is being run.

Firejail uses the linux kernel security features. It's used to restrict access to files and system capabilities from programs running on a computer.

You can run an application entirely in memory with this command (you must specify the path to the process).

> firejail --private /usr/bin/librewolf

Firejail is a program that restricts untrusted applications, and gives a process its own private access of the globally shared kernel and kernel resources including network, process table and mount table.
