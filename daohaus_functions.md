Questions:

Shall we also include this in the governance?:

>"Proposal Deposit: Used to protect against member spam. Deposited by user when sponsoring a proposal. Returned to their internal balance (minus processing reward if applicable) after the proposal is processed.

Proposal Reward: Used to reward members who process proposals. Originally meant to reimburse those spending gas to process proposals, so not as necessary on networks like xDAI and Polygon."

**Ragequit:**

Ragequit is easy. the member can choose how many Shares to ragequit.

**Add proposal:**  
https://daohaus.club/docs/users/manage-proposal-playlists

**Add new member:**  
https://daohaus.club/docs/users/add-member

Includes:  
- Proposal title  
- Short description  
- Shares requested  
- Token tribute

In Daohaus to become a member the proposal need to be sponsored by an existing member (vouch) and then everyone need to vote on the proposal.
This is aligning both with the proposal of a vouch system as well as minimum tribute.
