# DarkFi

**Website:** [https://dark.fi](https://dark.fi)  
**Production stage:** [Testnet Alpha](https://dark.fi/insights/testnet-v1a.html)  
**Token:** DRK  

## Problem

This system is based on a surveillance mega-machine. An architecture of oppression structured on user control. The society has lost its moral and political fabric and is unable to self-organize or act with initiative. The corporate state seeks to monopolize economic life through ie. CBDC and regulatory measures. 

## Solution

DarkFi provides the needed infrastructure to regain agency, power and expand the dark forest of encryption:

* **Anonymous:** Anti-fragile L1 to create and run anonymous apps. 
* **Uncensored:** Secured by anonymous proof-of-stake Ouroboros Crypsinous.
* **Sovereign:** Includes a simple ZK assembly language, Halo2 zkVM and a WASM runtime.

# DarkFi & Lunarpunk Mission

DarkFi is a not just a privacy oriented crypto project, but is the only project providing a wide range of private and anonymous services such as payments, swaps, DEX, NFTs and is also developing an anon dao primitive. The transfer to DarkFi from transparent chains is easy as they will provide an anon ETH bridge. The narrative of lunarpunk originates from DarkFi even though it has been widely adopted and practiced by other people and projects. 

## Use Cases

[**Transactions**](https://darkrenaissance.github.io/darkfi/development/darkfi_money_contract/index.html)

The user can make tranctions with an arbitrary number. The tokens are anonymous and rely on zero-knowledge proofs to ensure validity without revealing any other information. Sender and receiver data, as well as the amount transacted, is hidden.

It is based on a mint and burn process](https://darkrenaissance.github.io/darkfi/architecture/anonymous_assets.html).

- [**Atomic Swaps**](https://darkrenaissance.github.io/darkfi/testnet/atomic-swap.html)  
- **Anon DEX**  
- **Anon NFTs**  
- [**Anon DAO primitive**](https://darkrenaissance.github.io/darkfi/development/darkfi_dao_contract/index.html) (Also see [https://dark.fi/insights/lunarpunk-practice.html](https://dark.fi/insights/lunarpunk-practice.html))  
     - This is hidden information:  
         - DAO treasury  
         - DAO parameters  
         - DAO participants  
         - Proposals  
         - [Voting](https://darkrenaissance.github.io/darkfi/zkas/examples/voting.html). Participants have to prove ownership of governance token to vote. Token weighten system.

        *Parameter for the DAO:*  
        - Proposer limit: # of governance tokens required to make a proposal.  
        - Quorum: # of governance tokens allocated to a proposal for it to pass.  
        - Approval ratio: ratio of yes/no votes required for a proposal to pass.  

[**Bridge from ETH**](https://darkrenaissance.github.io/darkfi/architecture/bridge.html)

>"Assume Alice wants to bridge 10 ETH from the Ethereum network into DarkFi. Alice would issue a bridging request and perform a VSS scheme with a network of nodes in order to create an Ethereum secret key, and with it - derive an Ethereum address. Using such a scheme should prevent any single party to retrieve the secret key and steal funds. This also means, for every bridging operation, a fresh and unused Ethereum address is generated and as such gives no convenient ways of tracing bridge deposits.

>Once the new address has been generated, Alice can now send funds to the address and either create some proof of deposit, or there can be an oracle that verifies the state on Ethereum in order to confirm that the funds have actually been sent.

>Once confirmed, the bridging smart contract is able to freshly mint the counterpart of the deposited funds on a DarkFi address of Alice's choice."

## Drawback

The regulations and proposals for further control measure as well as repression against those who develop privacy oriented crypto projects, such as Tornaso cash, will also render DarkFi team in a precarious situation. Several squad members have been speaking publically and will be scrutinized and probably face attempts from centralized authority to shut the project down. 

# Conclusion

DarkFi is a project which is developing an essential part of a privacy oriented ecosystem. It is unique and include primitives that cannot be found elsewhere. To invest in DarkFi will give value to LunarDAO community and users worldwide as well as providing means for the team do realize this innovation.

# DarkFi Community

DarkFi are free software and linux OGs at the core. They developed and are using a terminal based chat tool, ircd. Their dev channel is open for anyone to participate or ask questions and there is also a telegram chat for lower threshold participation.
