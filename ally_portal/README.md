# LunarDAO Ally Portal

Ally portal is a database of organizations on the pursuit of privacy, anonymity and decentralization. This list of projects and primitives is to inform LunarDAO Squad (the investors) about possible investment proposals and to provide step by step information for the teams seaking for support.

## Investment Thesis

[LunarDAO](https://lunardao.net/) is an **INVESTMENT FUND INTO PRIVACY PROJECTS & ANONYMITY TOOLING**, a squad wealth based DAO spreading [Lunarpunk narrative and philosophy](https://wiki.lunardao.net/). 

### Problem

Anonymity and privacy oriented developers will face an increasing difficulty in finding support among traditional VC's and investment funds, because of regulatory measures. This will lead into a dynamic where the developing teams will be forced to sell their work underpriced to counterparties who don't share the same vision. This scenario a portrays privacy as a taboo, developers are under stress and value is extracted from the ecosystem.

We don't accept the future to be so grim. The prospect of privacy is ultimately bullish. LunarDAO offers a solution.

### Solution

We form a decentralized squad of sovereign individuals, lunarpunks, to allocate resources together and assemble squad wealth. The DAO leverages collective power and becomes an investor. The community discuss which tools are needed to empower the ecosystem, the [research committee](https://wiki.lunardao.net/anoma.html) looks for the solutions, lists them in and lists them in the [Ally Portal](https://github.com/lunardao/research/tree/master/ally_portal#primitives). The Squad members  vote on the proposals and invests in the chosen projects.

**Gains**

* The privacy projects will get supported by a decentralized, anonymous organization, aligned with their mission.  
* The teams will be provided with the needed resources to develop, grow and deliver.  
* LunarDAO Squad is a privacy investor building a treasury (portfolio) of accumulated privacy assets.  
* The value is conserved in the ecosystem, both parties profit from the upcoming cycle.  
* While leveraging collective power, every individual is protected against majority rule and can exit the DAO any time with 100% of their shares (without any fee).

We believe that the loop of tightening regulations and growing demand for privacy and anonymity is inevitable, these events will happen with or without us. We can strenghten the ecosystem, capture the value and grow squad wealth, or be left out in the desert with regressive regFi.

## Primitives 

To address the most outstanding problems, LunarDAO research committee focuses on the following primitives:

| **PRIMITIVE** | **SOLUTION** | **DEV TEAMS** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Anonymous DAOs** | Organizational governance without restrictions | DarkFi, Aragon |
| **Aztec connect fork** | ETH zk mixer/anonymizer | Open call out! |
| **Anonymity/privacy first smart-contract L1** | Fully anonymous native layer, allowing for dApps, DAOs etc | DarkFi, Navcoin|
| **Secure p2p broadcast layer, coin covenants, trustless lightclients,** | Censorship resistant, unix composability, decentralized applications | Mel Project |

### Projects & Teams

As a solution to the needed primitives, the following projects are considered to reach out and invest in their development: 

| **PROJECT** | **DESCRIPTION** | **STAGE** | **RESEARCH** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[DarkFi](https://dark.fi)** | Fully anonymous L1, anonymous DAO primitive, lunarpunk vanguards | *[Testnet alpha](https://dark.fi/insights/testnet-v1a.html)* | *[Report](https://github.com/lunardao/research/blob/master/ally_portal/darkfi.md)* |
| **[Mel Project](https://melproject.org/en/)** | zero-trust, light client, locally based apps - decentralization & network cencorship resistance through high composability | *[Mainnet beta](https://docs.melproject.org/developer-guides/run-a-full-node)* | *[Report](https://github.com/lunardao/research/blob/master/ally_portal/mel_project.md)* |
| **[Navcoin](https://navcoin.org/)** | [PePoS: a Privacy-enhanced Proof of Stake protocol](https://medium.com/nav-coin/announcing-pepos-a-privacy-enhanced-proof-of-stake-protocol-95c3149e8bd6) | *[Devnet](https://github.com/aguycalled/blsct-stake)* |  |

## Process

To support privacy projects by investing in them is the main purpose of LunarDAO. Planting seeds for the lunarpunk dark forest of cryptography, autonomy and users' knowledge. To choose meaningful projects and help them to grow is vital. As a reward for the LunarDAO community is the shared value of these projects in the form of their token and or knowledge and tools they build. It is a mutual harmony in which a growth of one empowers the other and vise versa. This symbiotic but diverse nature slowly but steadily replaces the bare desert of surveillance and hegemony.

### Investment Flow

*In examples we will use place holders X, Y & Z for supported projects and Tx, Ty & Tz for their tokens*

Project X is proposed to be financialy supported by LunarDAO in exhcange for # of Tx tokens or any other value to the lunarpunk ecosystem. After a community discussion and research an [investment LIP](https://wiki.lunardao.net/lip-0001.html#lip-categories--types) is submitted. In this LIP must be clearly defined:

```yaml
1. Name of the project
2. Date
3. Project X's value to the ecosystem (problem solving, new primitives, tools, knowledge, monetary etc)
4. Requested size of support in USD terms
5. Offered amount of Project X tokens Tx and price per USD (if the project is monetary based)
6. Trigger event: Tokens Tx will be send to LunarDAO treasury/Time period needed for execution or expected time of launch (when Tx becomes liquid)
7. Is the team X supported by private investors or VCs, other DAOs (or plans to) or just LunarDAO?
8. If yes: In which size and what is the price of token Tx to other supporting subjects?
9. If project X is token based: Tx tokenomics/release schedule
10. Project X's wallet address to recieve the support
11. LunarDAO treasury wallet address to recieve token Tx in agreed time, amount and price: lunarpunksquad.eth
```
LunarDAO Squad votes on the proposal of investment (see [Governance](https://github.com/lunardao/dao#voting) for more details). Project X escrows the promised tokens to LunarDAO treasury as a part of the on-chain proposal, or in case of an illiquid (yet) token Tx, a SAFT NFT (under construction) will be minted by Project X for LunarDAO in exchange for the support sent to the project X's wallet address.

## Governance TL:DR

- Write an [LIP](https://wiki.lunardao.net/lip-0001.html) (LunarDAO Improvement Proposal).  
- Post in on the [forum](https://forum.lunardao.net/c/proposals/) and discuss with the community.  
- When proposal finalized announce voting.  
- Submit proposal on-chain
- The voting is opened for 72h, after this time there will be a grace period during which any member can ragequit if they disagree with the outcome of the vote.  
- 50% + 1 $VOX of voting amount is needed for a proposal to be approved, otherwise the proposal is rejected.
- If approved --> Funds are sent to the supported project.
