# LunarDAO Ally Portal

Ally portal is a database of organizations on the pursuit of privacy, anonymity and decentralization. List of projects to potentially support in their development.

## Problems & Solutions

### Primitives 

To address the mmost outstanding problems, LunarDAO research committee focuses on the following primitives:

| **PRIMITIVE** | **SOLUTION** | **DEV TEAMS** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Anonymous DAOs** | Organizational governance without restrictions | DarkFi, Aragorn |
| **Aztec connect fork** | ETH zk mixer/anonymizer | |
| **Anonymity/privacy first smart-contract L1** | Fully anonymous native layer, allowing for dApps, DAOs etc | DarkFi, Navcoin|
| **Secure p2p broadcast layer, coin covenants, trustless lightclients,** | censorship resistance, unix composability, decentralized applications | Mel Project |

### Projects & Teams

LunarDAO is looking into the following projects as a proposal for partnership and investment.

| **PROJECT** | **DESCRIPTION** | **STAGE** | **RESEARCH** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **![DarkFi](https://dark.fi)** | Fully anonymous L1, anonymous DAO primitive, lunarpunk vanguards | *[testnet aplpha](https://dark.fi/insights/testnet-v1a.html)* | *[report](https://github.com/lunardao/research/blob/master/ally_portal/darkfi.md)* |
| **[Mel Project](https://melproject.org/en/)** | zero-trust, light client, locally based apps - decentralization & network cencorship resistance through high composability | *[mainnet beta](https://docs.melproject.org/developer-guides/run-a-full-node)* | *[report](https://github.com/lunardao/research/blob/master/ally_portal/mel_project.md)* |
| **[Navcoin](https://navcoin.org/)** | [PePoS: a Privacy-enhanced Proof of Stake protocol](https://medium.com/nav-coin/announcing-pepos-a-privacy-enhanced-proof-of-stake-protocol-95c3149e8bd6) | *[devnet](https://github.com/aguycalled/blsct-stake)* |  |
